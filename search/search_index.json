Keeper hooks into Proguard/R8 to add extra keep rules based on what androidTest classes use from the target app\u2019s sources. This is necessary because the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) does not currently factor in androidTest usages of target app sources when running the minification step, which can result in runtime errors if APIs used by tests are removed. This is (really) useful only if you run your instrumentation tests against your minified release builds! If you don\u2019t run these tests against minified builds, then you don\u2019t need this plugin. The build type that you test against is controlled by the testBuildType flag, which is set to debug by default. This is a workaround until AGP supports this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/126429384 . Note: Keeper uses private APIs from AGP and could break between releases. It is currently tested against AGP versions 3.5.3, 3.6.0-rc01, and 4.0.0-alpha09 (or whatever ci_agp_version env vars are described here . Installation \u00b6 Keeper is distributed via Maven Central. Apply the keeper Gradle plugin in your application\u2019s build.gradle. buildscript { dependencies { // ... classpath \"com.slack.keeper:keeper:x.y.z\" } } apply plugin: \"com.android.application\" // <- Keeper only works with com.android.application! apply plugin: \"com.slack.keeper\" Snapshots of the development version are available in Sonatype\u2019s snapshots repository . Configuration \u00b6 As mentioned above, Keeper\u2019s default behavior with no configuration will enable it for all androidTest variants. This may not be what you want for your actual production builds that you plan to distribute. Normally, your app variant\u2019s minification task doesn\u2019t depend on compilation of its corresponding androidTest variant. This means you can call assembleRelease and assembleAndroidTestRelease won\u2019t inherently run. Keeper, however, changes this since it requires the compiled androidTest sources in order to correctly infer how they use APIs in the app variant. For a production build, you likely do want these \u201ctest-only\u201d APIs removed if possible though. There are a few patterns to better control this behavior via Gradle property. Simplest solution \u00b6 The simplest solution is to add a new build type that extends release but is solely used for these tests. This way it\u2019s identical to release in everything except the name. android { buildTypes { staging { initWith release } } testBuildType = \"staging\" } Now Keeper will only wire for the StagingAndroidTest build type and the assembleRelease dependency tree will remain untouched. This is the recommended solution, since builds that need this plugin likely already have custom logic in place for controlling testBuildType and it avoids messing with your normal release build. This is what we do internally at Slack as well. Property-based Examples \u00b6 Let\u2019s assume an example command to build a production app with custom property productionBuild . ./gradlew :myapp:assembleRelease -PproductionBuild = true Use the testBuildType option \u00b6 If you avoid setting your testBuildType to your \u201crelease\u201d build type in a production build, then Keeper won\u2019t configure your release artifact to depend on test sources since your release variant would no longer be the testedVariant of any androidTest variants. android { // ... if ( hasProperty ( \"productionBuild\" )) { testBuildType = \"debug\" } else { testBuildType = \"release\" } } Avoid applying the plugin entirely \u00b6 This is probably the simplest approach, but not as dynamic as controlling the testBuildType . if (! hasProperty ( \"productionBuild\" )) { apply plugin: \"com.slack.keeper\" } \u00b6 Everyone\u2019s project is different, so you should do whatever works for you! We\u2019re open to suggestions of better ways to support configuration for this, so please do file issues if you have any proposals. Custom R8 behavior \u00b6 Keeper uses R8\u2019s PrintUses CLI under the hood for rules inference. By default it uses R8 version 1.6.53 . If you want to customize what version is used, you can specify the dependency via the keeperR8 configuration. Note that these must be tags from R8\u2019s r8-releases/raw maven repo. dependencies { keeperR8 \"com.android.tools:r8:x.y.z\" } If you want to add custom JVM arguments to its invocation (i.e. for debugging), you and set them via the keeper extension. keeper { /** * Optional custom jvm arguments to pass into the R8 `PrintUses` execution. Useful if you want * to enable debugging in R8. Default is empty. * * Example: `listOf(\"-Xdebug\", \"-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=5005,server=y,suspend=y\")` */ r8JvmArgs = [] } Under the hood \u00b6 The general logic flow: Create a custom r8 configuration for the R8 dependency. Register two jar tasks per androidTest variant. One for all the classes in its target testedVariant and one for all the classes in the androidTest variant itself. This will use their variant-provided JavaCompile tasks and KotlinCompile tasks if available. Register a infer${androidTestVariant}UsageForKeeper task that plugs the two aforementioned jars into R8\u2019s PrintUses CLI and outputs the inferred proguard rules into a new intermediate .pro file. Finally - the generated file is wired in to Proguard/R8 via private task APIs and setting their configurationFiles to include our generated one. Appropriate task dependencies (via inputs/outputs, not dependsOn ) are set up, so this is automatically run as part of the target app variant\u2019s full minified APK. The tasks themselves take roughly ~20 seconds total extra work in our Slack android app, with the infer and app jar tasks each taking around 8-10 seconds and the androidTest jar taking around 2 seconds.
